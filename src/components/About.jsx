          My name is <span>Nik Vogrinec</span>, and I come from a small country
          in the center of Europe called <span>Slovenia</span>. I found my
          passion for programming while browsing the web and wondering how
          websites are built. I have a bunch of <span>technologies</span> in my
          tool belt, many of which I use daily. I specialize in{" "}
          <span>web development</span>. Most of my days are spent with{" "}
          <span>PHP or Node</span> on the back-end and <span>React</span> on the
          front-end with <span>Tailwind</span> and
          <span> Bootstrap</span> for styling. <span>I love learning</span> new
          technologies and implementing them in my various projects. Let's have
          a chat?
